# Suicide Data exploration

## Dataset

The dataset can be found kaggle [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/data-raw/diamonds.csv),

The da

ta consist of information recording over 20000 age range suicide acts per year

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
price of a diamond and its carat weight, with modifying effects from the cut,
color, and clarity grades given to the diamond. The relationship is
approximately linear between price and carat when price is transformed to be on
a logarithmic scale and carat transformed to be on a cube-root scale. I found a
somewhat surprising result initially when the marginal trend for the cut, color,
and clarity variables indicated that higher diamond quality was associated with
lower price. However, higher diamond quality was also associated with smaller
diamonds. When I isolated diamonds of a single carat weight, there was a clear
positive relationship between higher diamond quality and higher diamond price.

Outside of the main variables of interest, I verified the relationship between
diamond carat weight and its x, y, and z dimensions. For the dataset given,
there was an interesting interaction in the categorical diamond quality
features. The lower clarity grades looked like they had slightly better
distribution of cut and color grades than diamonds with the higher clarity
grades

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the population and GDP since rich countries, in general, are more populous

Also, between the number of suicides and the population, if there are more people, then more suicides. The correlation between GDP per capita and the world of the country occurs negatively since the first world countries have a higher income, and third world, lower income.

## Key Insights for Presentation


In this article, the idea is a quantitative exploratory analysis of data on the amount of suicide. Overall, we can see that the data show what we see in newspapers, television and the like, in my view most of the conclusions that I reached were already predictable; only imagined a more significant number of teenagers committing suicide, which was not seen in the data.

I tried not to justify the graphs for demographic, social and economic reasons, keeping the article neutral. However, there may be several explanations for the numbers available.
